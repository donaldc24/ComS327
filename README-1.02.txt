This is my Terrian Generation c code for 1.02, which meets all of the specified requirements as follows:
	- Has the inputs n, s, e, w, f x y, and q
	- Prints error message and then reprints last grid if invalid input
	- Has 399x399 maps of size 21x80
	- Has Probabilities to make PokeCenters/Marts less likely the farther you go
	- All path entrances and exits line up when going to tangent map
	- World edges have no exits
	- All visited maps are saved in a 4d array and do not get re generated
